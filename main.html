    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>
      Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to
      complete as a function of the size of the input to the algorithm. It is a
      theoretical concept used in computer science to analyze and compare
      algorithms based on their efficiency in terms of execution time. In the
      context of time complexity analysis, the size of the input is often
      denoted by "n," and time complexity is expressed using Big O notation. Big
      O notation provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's
      running time as a function of the input size.

      <b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory or space an
      algorithm requires relative to the size of the input it processes. It
      evaluates how the memory usage of an algorithm grows as the input size
      increases. Like time complexity, space complexity is expressed using Big O
      notation. Space complexity includes both the auxiliary space extra space
      used by the algorithm, not including the input and the input space space
      required by the input itself.
      O(n) Linear Space The space usage is directly proportional to the input size.
