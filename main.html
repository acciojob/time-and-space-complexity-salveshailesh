    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>
      Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to
      complete as a function of the size of the input to the algorithm. efficient use of time in programming.

    <p>
      <b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory or space an
      algorithm requires relative to the size of the input it processes. It
      evaluates how the memory usage of an algorithm grows as the input size
      increases. O(n) Linear Space The space usage is directly proportional to the input size.
